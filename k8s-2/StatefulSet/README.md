For a StatefulSet with N replicas, when Pods are being deployed, they are created sequentially, in order from {0..N-1}. Examine the output of the kubectl get command in the first terminal. Eventually, the output will look like the example below.

Pods in a StatefulSet have a unique ordinal index and a stable network identity.
for i in 0 1; do kubectl exec web-$i -- sh -c 'hostname'; done
kubectl run -i --tty --image busybox:1.28 dns-test --restart=Never --rm  nslookup web-0.nginx
kubectl run -i --tty --image busybox:1.28 dns-test --restart=Never --rm  nslookup web-1.nginx

kubectl get pvc

kubectl scale sts web --replicas=5

--- 
kubectl delete sts web
kubectl delete sts web --cascade=false

# Headless service
When you create a headless service by setting clusterIP None, no load-balancing is done and no cluster IP is allocated for this service. Only DNS is automatically configured. When you run a DNS query for headless service, you will get the list of the Pods IPs and usually client dns chooses the first DNS record.

```
$ kubectl create deployment nginx --image=stenote/nginx-hostname

$ kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment nginx
```
Expose a headless service by setting --cluster-ip=None
```
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --name nginxheadless --cluster-ip=None
```

Expose a standart service (ClusterIP type)
```
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --name nginxclusterip --port=80  --target-port=80
```
To test our case we need to run DNS queries and curl command. arunvelsriram/utils contains all the tool that we need.
```
$ kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 --rm utils -it --image arunvelsriram/utils bash

$ host nginxheadless
```
As you can see above, host nginxheadless query returns Pods IP list in the response. Let’s curl to this service name.
```
$ for i in $(seq 1 10) ; do curl nginxheadless; done

$ curl -v nginxheadless
```

Let’s test clusterIP service
```
$ host nginxclusterip

$ for i in $(seq 1 10) ; do curl nginxclusterip; done
```
Perfect! clusterIP service creates a single cluster IP and distribute the traffic between pods.
